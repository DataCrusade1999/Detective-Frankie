# Detective-Frankie

## How to run it on your system

- Install [gactions cli](https://developers.google.com/assistant/conversational/quickstart?authuser=0#install_the_gactions_command-line_tool)

- Then add `gactions cli` to your system path.

- Go to [actions console](https://console.actions.google.com/) make a project named `detective-frankie`.

- Fire up your `gactions cli` inside the `sdk` directory then type `gactions push` but before doing all this you might have to authorize yourself first the instruction onscreen will be simple so you should be able to follow it.

## Inspiration

We wanted to create a detective game on theme with the hackathon. We wanted to add a MLH zest to it. Hence our main characters are Frankie and TNR

## What it does

It is a Google Actions game that can be played using Google Assistant. The detective game follows a storyline and takes the player on a journey.

## How we built it

We built it using Google Actions.

## Challenges we ran into

- The whole flow of the game was tricky to create
- Firebase deployment takes a week and hence our game can be played only by the creator.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We managed to work our way around the Actions Console without any knowledge of how it works
We managed to create the game by following the documentation which was very gratifying

## What we learned

How to work our way around the Actions Console and create a Google Action for Google Assistant

## What's next for Detective Frankie

The storyline can take a lot more turns.
A web app integration is also in line.
